    <h2>Instructions (version 4)</h2>

    <p>Duration: 50 min + 5 de tolerance</p>

    <p>We want to implement a <i>software</i> to help an IT company that provides ITConsultant services with the management
	of their employees. In this challenge, there exist two types of employees: those who pertain to the human resources
	management area, and the IT (information technology) experts, who pertain to ITConsultant.

	<p>A company is characterized by its name. A company can have multiple employees, but each employee only the belongs to
	a single company.</p>

	<p>A employee is identified by its id (<code>int</code>), name (<code>String</code>) and monthly salary (<code>int</code>).
	The human resource employees do not have any extra attribute, however, the IT employees are associated their respective hourly
    rate (<code>int</code>), as well as the name of the client (<code>String</code>) to which they are allocated.</p>

    <p><strong>Tasks</strong></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Create the package <code>org.dropproject.samples.itcompanyassignment</code>. All code for this mini-test must be created
            within this package.
        </li>
        <li>Analyse, in terms of inheritance, which relation exists between the described types of employees, knowing that
        the classes <code>Employee</code>, <code>HRWorker</code> e <code>ITConsultant</code> must be created;
        </li>
        <li>The super class should contain a constructor with all the attributes identified for employees, namely
            id (<code>int</code>), name (<code>String</code>) and salary (<code>int</code>). However, it should not
            be possible to instantiate an object using the super class's constructor;
        </li>
        <li>The human resources worked type is represented by the <code>HRWorker</code> class, and it does no have
            any attributes besides the ones defined for the <code>Employee</code> class.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add to your <code>HRWorker</code> class the following method:
            <ul>
                <li>A <code>public String toString()</code> method, which must be implemented to return the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>"&#60;id&#62; | &#60;name&#62; | &#60;salary&#62; (HR);</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>Example with human resources employee:
<pre>
1 | Carolina Feliz | 1300 (HR)
</pre>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        </li>
        Add, to the appropriate classes, the following methods:
            <ul>
                <li>A <code>public int getId()</code> method, which returns the employee's ID.</li>
                <li>A <code>public String getName()</code> method, which returns the employee's name.</li>
                <li>A <code>public int getSalary()</code> method, which returns the employee's salary.</li>
                <li>A <code>public int getValue()</code> method, which returns the IT employee's hourly rate.</li>
                <li>A <code>public String getClient()</code> method, which returns the name of the client to which
                    the IT employee is allocated.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The <code>ITConsultant</code> class, wich represents the IT Consultant, must have a constructor, all the attributes
            defined for a employee, as well as the specific attributes value (<code>int</code>) and client (<code>String</code>).
        </li>
        <li>Add to your <code>ITConsultant</code> class the following methods:
            <ul>
                <li>A <code>public String toString()</code> method, which must be implemented to return the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>"&#60;id&#62; | &#60;name&#62; | &#60;salary&#62; (IT Consultant)\n
                            &#60;client&#62; | &#60;value&#62; (hourly value)";
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>Example of employee of type <i>ITConsultant</i>:
<pre>
1 | Diogo Costa | 1800 (IT Consultant)
Daimler | 26 (hourly value)
</pre>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Create the <code>Company</code> class, with the name attribute (<code>String</code>). Don't forget that the
            company has employees. The <code>Company</code> class, besides the constructor defined by its attribute, must
            have the followind methods:
            <ul>
                <li>A <code>public String getName()</code> method, which must return the companies' name.</li>
                <li>A <code>public ArrayList&#60;Employee&#62; getEmployees()</code> method, which must return
                    all the companies' employees.
                </li>
                <li>A <code>public void addEmployee(Employee employee)</code> method, which allows
                    adding a employee to the company.
                </li>
                <li>A <code>public Employee getEmployeeHighestHourlyRate()</code> method, which returns the
                    employee with the highest hourly rate. If there is a tie (i.e. more than one employee with the same
                    maximum hourly rate value), the algorithm must consider the employee whose name is alphabetically
                    smaller (e.g. since "A" is alphabetically lower than "I", when "Alf" and "Inete" have the same
                    hourly rate, "Alf" must be returned);
                </li>
                <li>A <code>public String toString()</code> method, which must be implemented to return the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>"The company &#60;name&#62; does not have employees." - if the company does not have any employee;
                        </li>
                        <li>"The company &#60;name&#62; has &#60;number_employees&#62; employees:" - if the company
                            has at least one employee. Besides that, the information for each employee should be display,
                            considering the respective type:
                        </li>
                        <li>"&#60;id&#62; | &#60;name&#62; | &#60;salary&#62; (HR)" - for human resource employees;
                        </li>
                        <li>"&#60;id&#62; | &#60;name&#62; | &#60;salary&#62; (IT Consultant)\n
                            &#60;client&#62; | &#60;value&#62; (hourly value)" - for IT employees;
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>Example of a company with 3 employees (one HR employee and two IT consultants):
                    <pre>
The company Clever Smart Reloaded Consulting has 3 employees:
1 | Ana Bela | 1200 (HR)
2 | João Mário | 1500 (IT Consultant)
Nova Base | 22 (hourly value)
3 | Ana Falcão | 1670 (IT Consultant)
Opensoft | 24 (hourly value)
</pre>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>You must create the <code>Main</code> class, which must contain the following methods:
            <ul>
                <li>The <code>main(...)</code> method, without behaviour (empty).</li>
                <li>A <code>public static Company myCompany()</code> method, which must return
                    an object of class <code>Company</code> with the following data:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Company name: the last 4 digits of <strong>your</strong> student ID.
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Attention</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Be careful to respect the indicated data types and formats.</li>
        <li>It is mandatory to respect the return syntaxes of the <code>toString()</code> methods.</li>
        <li>It may be necessary to implement abstract methods that allow differentiating the various types of employees.</li>
    </ul>
